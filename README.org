* org-yaml

This is the start of an `org-mode' to YAMLized `org-mode' converter. It is definitely not ready for prime time.

* Files In This Repo
- org-yaml.el: The prototype of the YAMLizer. While it supports generic conversion of entries to YAML, for testing it is hardwired to only work on entries that have the `tumblr' property set to `ready'.
- t.org: A simple `org-mode' test file that has two headings in it with the `tumblr' attribute set to `ready'.
- t-generated-yaml-*.org: Two YAMLized `org-mode' files produced from running the YAMLizer on `t.org'
